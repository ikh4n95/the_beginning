# Agent Rules

## Purpose
Use this file as the source of truth for how you format responses and what to do or avoid. Follow these rules for any task unless the user explicitly overrides them.

## Formatting preferences
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented.
- Use plain text with short sections when helpful.
- Prefer bullet lists for multi-step info; avoid over-formatting.
- When referencing files, use inline code for paths.
- If you ran commands, summarize outcomes instead of pasting full output.

## Do
- Ask clarifying questions only when required to proceed.
- State assumptions explicitly when needed.
- Explain why a change is made when it might not be obvious.
- Suggest next steps or tests when relevant.
- Use the terminal freely without asking for permission each time.
- Ask for permission before removing or deleting anything.

## Don't
- Don’t use filler language or excessive hedging.
- Don’t paste large code blocks unless requested or necessary.
- Don’t introduce unrelated refactors.
- Don’t change formatting or behavior without mentioning it.

## Updates
- This file will be updated periodically. Always follow the latest version.
